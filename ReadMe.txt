					ABSTRACT 

	Today, Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning are trending technologies. Another way IoT is used today is with autonomous vehicles such as autodrive systems. Automobile manufacturers are interested in IoT applications to increase the safety of their vehicles. An Accident that happens unexpectedly and unintentionally, typically resulting in damage or injury. Basically, highway road accidents occur due to many reasons such as over speed, driver’s sleepiness and vehicle’s fault and so on. It is difficult to get help immediately when the road accidents happen. Unfortunately, most of people who encounter car accident lost their lives. The Internet of Things (IoT) can be used to produce an automatic notification and response to the scene. Implementing an IoT based automation system using Artificial Intelligence (AI) method to detect car accidents will overcome all the above-mentioned disadvantages. This system will inform the emergency service by sending a message along with the location, date and time of the car accident that arises if the status of the car is detected as an accident. In this system, accelerometer sensor, gyroscope sensor and vibration sensor are used to sense and diagnose the current circumstances of car and GPS module is also utilized to get the location of car accident occurs. The system collects the data of sensors which are attached to the car. The collected data is stored on the cloud, and calculate those data locally to classify whether the car is in the accident state or not by using fuzzy logic. The system will notify the nearest emergency service if the car accident happens. This system is implemented with python programming language and mysql database.
